## Commit message standards

This repo follows the [engineering-standards commit-message spec](https://github.com/florianhorner/engineering-standards/blob/main/specs/commit-message-spec.md).

**Quick rule:** Conventional Commits (`type(scope): subject`, ≤72 chars). A `Why:` body line is REQUIRED when type is `feat` AND >50 lines changed; otherwise optional.

**Local invocation:** Use the `/commit` skill in Claude Code / Conductor. Default behavior is dry-run (drafts a message and shows the validator output without committing); pass `--commit` to actually create the commit. Manual `git commit` works too — the local `commit-msg` hook validates either path.

**Per-repo cheat sheet:** [`./CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) carries the 30-second cheat sheet, good/bad examples, banned patterns, exempt subjects, bot allowlist, and bypass policy. It is self-sufficient for cloud agents (Claude Code Cloud, Codex web) that only see repo-local files.

**Machine-readable rules:** [`.config/commit-rules.json`](.config/commit-rules.json) is a SHA-pinned vendored copy of the upstream `commit-rules.json`. The validator binary, commit-msg hook, and CI workflow all read this file. Do not hand-edit — re-run `bootstrap-repo.sh` to refresh.

**Bypass:** `git commit --no-verify` requires a `Policy-Override: <reason>` trailer to pass CI. Logged to `~/.commit-bypass.log` by the pre-push hook.
